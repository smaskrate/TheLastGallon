# Architecture decisions

Each entry: decision, reason, evidence, consequences. Superseded decisions stay
listed with their replacement.

## D-001 Pin one build (42.21.0)
* Decision: support exactly 42.21.0 (`4a0e9546ec`). `mod.info` uses
  `versionMin=42.21` and no `versionMax`; on other builds the mod logs a
  warning (and the UI shows it) instead of refusing to load.
* Reason: the specification forbids advertising generic B42 compatibility;
  a hard `versionMax` would block development the day the game updates.
* Evidence: `environment.md`.

## D-002 Repository and package layout
* Decision: repository root = `<game>/mods/TheLastGallon` (chosen by the
  user). Runtime package = `Contents/mods/TheLastGallon/{42,common}` (Workshop
  layout). Development experiments live in a separate mod
  `tests/ingame/TheLastGallonHarness` that is never packaged.
* Reason: the spec keeps tests, tools and art sources out of the package.
* Evidence: BC `getAllModFoldersAux` / `getModVersionDirName` (G01).

## D-003 Domain tests on the game's Kahlua VM
* Decision: `tools/kahlua-runner` (reflection only, JDK 17 `--release 17`) runs
  Lua on `se.krka.kahlua` from `projectzomboid.jar` with the shipped
  `stdlib.lua`, launched by the game's Java 25.
* Reason: no standalone Lua is installed and the shipped VM is the real target
  dialect (Kahlua quirks would be missed by PUC Lua).

## D-004 Isolated dev cache outside `<game>/mods`, mirror deployment
* Decision: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\TheLastGallon\devcache`, `options.ini`
  pre-created, mods deployed with `robocopy /MIR`, no junctions.
* Reason: incident of 2026-10-30 (`environment.md`): first-run
  `copyPasteFolders("mods")` copied the repository into itself through a
  junction.

## D-005 Lua subset rules
* No `next`, `math.random`, `table.unpack`, `goto`, bit operations; floored
  modulo through `TLG.Num.mod`; no recursion deeper than a few hundred frames;
  deterministic iteration through `TLG.Tables.sortedKeys`; no structured error
  values (functions return `{ok=false, reason=...}` tables).
* Evidence: runtime probes (engine-capabilities, "Lua runtime").

## D-006 Quantity, composition and consumption ownership per adapter
| Adapter | Quantity owner | Composition owner | Consumption owner | Sidecar store |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Item fluid container | native `FluidContainer` | native fluids (TLG fluids for alternatives and contaminants) | native (any vanilla use) | item modData `tlg` |
| Vehicle tank | native part content amount | TLG sidecar | native engine | part modData `tlg` |
| Generator | native `IsoGenerator.fuel` | TLG sidecar | native burn | object modData `tlg`; item modData while carried |
| Station reservoir | TLG reservoir record (litres) | TLG | TLG dispensing (managed pumps) | global ModData `TLG_Sites` |
| Mod machines/tanks | TLG | TLG | TLG | object modData / global ModData |

* TLG never subtracts fuel that a native owner consumes. Changes TLG did not
  initiate are reconciled: a decrease removes all components proportionally;
  an increase of unknown origin is mixed in as "untracked inflow" with the
  pessimistic world-baseline condition (never fresh). Diagnostics are logged.
* Reason: spec §8 (one consumption owner, reconciliation, no fresh fuel from
  unknown changes).

## D-007 Native fluids for alternative fuels and contaminants
* Decision: script fluids `TLG_Ethanol`, `TLG_Diesel`, `TLG_Biodiesel` (and,
  for contamination, `TLG_FuelWater`, `TLG_FuelSediment`) in category `Fuel`
  with a Fuel blend whitelist.
* Reason: native item containers then carry composition through every native
  transfer, including code paths TLG cannot hook; only chemical condition
  needs a sidecar. Vanilla `Water` cannot blend with `Petrol` (RT-DS), so water
  contamination needs its own fuel-category fluid.
* Consequence: vanilla refuel menus only accept containers that contain
  `Petrol`; TLG adds its own menu entries for other fuels (G03).

## D-008 Degradation as a mixable concentration with closed-form aging
* Decision: each fuel component carries `deg`, a degradation-product index
  that mixes linearly by volume. Aging follows
  `d(deg)/dt = k(t) * (1 + a * deg)`, integrated in closed form over the
  cumulative driver `K = ∫k dt` (piecewise-constant daily environment).
* Reason: linear mixing makes "a small fresh addition cannot reset a large
  degraded reserve" hold by construction; closed form makes one large advance
  equal to many small ones up to floating-point error (spec §7, §15).
* Consequence: suitability is a separate mapping from `deg` to grades and
  consumer effects (tunable independently of campaign speed).

## D-009 World clock
* Decision: canonical time = `getGameTime():getWorldAgeHours()` (hours since
  world start, double). Calendar/season derived from the world start date.
* Evidence: BC `GameTime.getWorldAgeHours()`; RT-DS shows it frozen on an
  empty paused server, so unloaded catch-up is driven by elapsed world time,
  never wall-clock time.

## D-010 Station dispensing for managed pumps
* Decision: a pump becomes "managed" when TLG initialises its site. Managed
  pumps dispense through TLG actions with one unit convention (reservoir in
  litres); `pipedFuelAmount` mirrors the reservoir for vanilla UI. Vanilla
  `ISTakeFuel`/`ISRefuelFromGasPump` are intercepted for managed pumps.
* Reason: vanilla paths disagree on units (1 L vs 1.25 L per unit) and
  `ISTakeFuel:complete()` duplicates the final increment (G06, SRC).
* Status: implemented in `TLG/Integration/Stations.lua` (both vanilla paths
  are settled after the fact: pump set to reservoir − litres delivered, can
  fluids set to the reservoir blend; fractional remainder kept). Adapter
  installs cleanly on the dedicated server; dispensing itself NOT RUN.

## D-011 Electrical priorities only where control exists
* Decision: dispatch priorities apply to TLG-owned consumers (chargers,
  machines). Vanilla appliances draw from a vanilla generator in aggregate and
  are shown as "uncontrolled load".
* Reason: no per-appliance control found (G10); the spec forbids showing a
  priority that cannot act.

## D-012 Multiplayer authority protocol
* Decision: clients send `sendClientCommand("TLG", command, args)` with
  `requestId`, object references and expected revisions; the server validates,
  advances participants to a common time, checks revisions/compatibility,
  bounds quantities, commits, increments revisions and replies with
  `sendServerCommand`. A bounded per-player request ledger makes retries
  idempotent. In SP the same handler runs locally.
* Reason: spec §14. Pure validation/commit logic lives in `TLG/Authority`
  and is unit-tested; the network transport is an adapter (G07 NOT RUN).

## D-013 Generator sidecar carried through pickup/placement
* Decision: wrap `ISTakeGenerator.complete` (object → item modData),
  `ISDropWorldItemAction.complete` (item → object: Java converts a dropped
  generator item in `IsoGridSquare.AddWorldInventoryItem`, BC, so this is the
  normal player path) and `IsoGenerator.new` (Lua placement paths). Device
  identity and conversion projects (`tlgDeviceId`, `tlgEngineId`,
  `tlgConv`) travel the same way.
* Evidence: SRC `ISTakeGenerator.lua:41-53`, `ISDropWorldItemAction.lua:81`;
  BC `setInfoFromItem`, `IsoGridSquare.AddWorldInventoryItem`.
* Status: implemented; `IsoGenerator.new` wrapping is the same mechanism
  proven for `FluidContainer.Transfer` (RT-DS). Pickup/drop NOT RUN (G05).

## D-015 Production machines are placeable items
* Decision: fermenter, stills and drying column are inventory items placed on
  the ground; the process record lives in item modData (`tlgProc`) and
  processing only advances while placed. B42 `entity` world objects were
  considered but their build/placement path is unverified at runtime.
* Reason: item modData travels with pickup (spec "picking up a processing
  machine"), vanilla placement/pickup need no new code, and vanilla models
  serve as placeholders (asset target: zero bespoke models for the first
  playable).
* Consequence: picking a running machine up pauses it on next access without
  crediting the carried time (conservative). Runtime persistence of
  world-item modData is NOT RUN.

## D-016 UI feedback through rich-text dialogs
* Decision: inspection and machine results are shown in `ISModalRichText`
  dialogs built from translated keys; unknown condition has its own wording.
* Reason: readable without relying on colour or tiny world labels (spec §16).

## D-014 Gas fuels are not liquids
* Decision: gases use normal cubic metres (Nm³); propane is displayed in kg
  (2.01 kg/Nm³). Vanilla `Base.PropaneTank` is a drainable with 5000 uses and
  no fluid container (RT-DS); the propane adapter maps uses ↔ Nm³.
* Reason: spec §5 forbids interchangeable liquid litres for gases.
